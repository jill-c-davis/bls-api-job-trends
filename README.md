# bls-api-job-trends
This project pulls labor market data using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) API, analyzes job growth trends by industry, and visualizes changes over time. It was created as part of a final project in IST 652 (Scripting for Data Analysis), and reflects an interest in making civic and economic data more accessible and actionable.
